	<h1>Lonnie Preston Phillips</h1>
	<p>“Lonnie Phillips” - Hello World</p>
	<p>Discord Username: Droppy#0894</p>
	<h1>Introduction</h1>
	<p>My name is Lonnie Phillips and I am a Computer Science Major. Right now I am not in a minor and I dont currently know what I might minor in later. I possibly might minor in music since I know how to play piano but its still undecided. I have one brother who is 8 years older than me and one sister who is 11 years older than me. My favorite food is banana pudding during my free time I usually like to practice playing piano or occasionally play video games which I dont really have as much time for as I used to.</p>
	<h1>What I hope to learn in this course</h1>
	<p>⚫I want to learn how to be an expert at programming
	⚫I want to have a better idea of what my career might be in the future
	⚫If possible I want to know more about how to secure a network since I might switch into a cyber security major in the future</p>
	<h1>My favorite hobby/activity</h1>
	<p>My favorite hobby currently is probably just trying to get better at piano. I started playing about 4 months ago and I've enjoyed it quite a bit. With all the work that I have now I havent really had much time to play but I still make time here and there. I just started getting into reading more also since I dont much of it at all. The last hobby I have is playing video games. I dont play as much as I use to because there is always something to do in college.</p>
